**PHPStorm Live Templates for TYPO3 / Fluid**

Simple copy the Fluid.xml file into your settings directory. Terminate PHPStorm before copy, because the file could be overwritten while exit.

The settings directory is located:

* For Mac and PHPStorm 7: `~/Library/Preferences/WebIde70/Templates`
* For Mac and PHPStorm 8: `~/Library/Preferences/WebIde80/Templates`
* For Windows and PHPStorm 7: -- not known, tell me if you know it --

HowTo use it
============

On Mac you can use the shortcut `cmd + J` to activate the Live Template search. Now tip simple the name of template you want to add to your HTML file. All Fluid templates starts with `fluid_` but you can also search for special template like `fluid_form_validationResults` by typing `form_val`.
